This is expressive enough to capture informal rules like ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂif some agent's actions  have been necessary to cause an event E then conclude atom caused(, E),ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ something that, to the best of our knowledge, had not been formalised in the literature. To this aim, we start from a first attempt that proposed Enab the syntax of logic programs with so-called causal literals. These causal literals are expressions that can be used in rule bodies and allow inspecting the derivation of some atom A in the program with respect to some query function ÃÂÃÂ. Depending on how these query functions are defined, we can model different types of causal relations such as sufficient, necessary or contributory causes, for instance. The initial approach was specifically focused o" # "n monotonic query functions. This was enough to cover sufficient cause-effect relations but, unfortunately, necessary and contributory are essentially non-monotonic. In this work, we define a semantics for non-monotonic causal literals showing that, not only extends the stable model semantics for normal logic programs, but also preserves many of its usual desirable properties for the extended syntax. Using this new semantics, we provide precise definitions of necessary and contributory causal relations and briefly explain their behaviour on a pair of typical examples from the Knowledge Representation literature.",

This expression contains both causal explanations (in the form of proof graphs built with rule labels) and terms under the scope of negation that stand for conditions that enable or disable the application of causal rules. Using some examples, we discuss how these new conditions, we respectively call enablers and inhibitors, are intimately related to default negation and have an essentially different nature from regular cause-effect relations. The most important result is a formal comparison to the recent algebraic approaches for justifications in logic programming: Why-not Provenance and Causal Graphs. We show that the current approach extends both Why-not Provenance and Causal Graphs justifications under the well-founded semantics and, as a byproduct, we also establish a formal relat" # "ion between these two approaches.",

abstract="Several proposals of the semantics of aggregates are based on different extensions of the stable model semantics, which makes it difficult to compare them. In this note, building upon a reductive approach to designing aggregates, we provide reformulations of some existing semantics in terms of propositional formulas, which help us compare the semantics and understand their properties in terms of their propositional formula representations. We also present a generalization of semantics of aggregates without involving grounding, and define loop formulas for programs with aggregates guided by the reductive approach.",
